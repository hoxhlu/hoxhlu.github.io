		<h1>Care Bears</h1>
		<hr>
		<h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
		<p><strong>Care Bears</strong> are multi-colored bears, originally painted in 1981 by artist Elena Kucharik to be used on greeting cards from American Greetings. In 1983, the characters were turned into plush teddy bears.
		</p>

<p>The characters headlined their own television series called Care Bears from 1985 to 1988. They also made three feature films: The Care Bears Movie (1985), Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation (1986), and The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland (1987).
</p>

<p>Each Care Bear is a different color and has a special "belly badge" that represents its personality. Adding to the Care Bear family is the "Care Bear Cousins", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, lamb, dog, cat, and horse created in the same style as the Care Bears.
</p>

<p>In 2002, new versions of the bears were manufactured by Play-Along Toys. These new Care Bears appeared in three computer animated films: Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot (2004), The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie (2005), and Care Bears: Oopsy Does It! (2007).
</p>

<p>A revival TV series Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot premiered on The Hub on June 2, 2012 for one season. A continuation with the same characters, Care Bears and Cousins, was commissioned by Netflix and premiered in 2015. That year, toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figurines, and blind bag collectibles) based on the series.
</p>

<p>The current TV series, Care Bears: Unlock the Magic, debuted on Boomerang SVOD on February 1, 2019, and has since tied in with a new toy line from Basic Fun!.

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>The Care Bears were initially created in 1981 by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the licensing division of the greeting card company American Greetings. Jack Chojnacki, the co-president of TCFC, introduced the first Care Bear to businessmen from American Greeting Cards and from the toy company Kenner in February 1981. On the employees' reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: "It had a high aaaaaah factor."[1]
</p>

<p>Artist Muriel Fahrion, who helped create Strawberry Shortcake's look, was among the franchise's first concept artists.[2] Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Fahrion designed the first six bears, creating greeting card themes for their belly graphics. Susan Trentel, Muriel's sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake, designed the Care Bears plush. Once out of the concept stage, children's book illustrator Elena Kucharik became the primary artist for the Care Bears, creating hundreds of full color illustrations for cards, books and various licensed products. TCFC's team of artists and writers created many characters in the line in a joint development by Those Characters From Cleveland and MAD (Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of General Mills).[3]:53
</p>

<p>American Greeting Cards kept the character program a secret until advertising was ready. At the start of the franchise, “Care Bears” was established as the project's working title.[4]
</p>
<h3>1982 launch</h3>
<p>On September 24, 1982, the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area's Society of Security Analysts. President Morry Weiss represented American Greetings; Jack Chojnacki and senior vice-president Henry Lowenthal from Cleveland represented Those Characters.
</p>

<p>The characters were produced as a toyline by Parker Brothers and Kenner the following spring[5] on a U.S. $5–6 million advertising budget[1][6] and a wholesale commitment worth U.S. 122.5 million.[6] American Greetings introduced the characters to the general public in February 1983,[7] with an appearance at New York City's Toy Fair;[8] 26 licensees were involved upon launch.[7] Among them was General Mills,[6] a food company which owned the board game manufacturer Parker Brothers.[9] In early 1983, Parker Brothers released six books featuring the Care Bears as part of its publishing division's first offerings.[9] On television, the original 10 Bears were featured in a syndicated special, Atkinson Film-Arts' The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings, produced and sponsored by Kenner.[3]:52
</p>

<p>In December 1983, American Greetings and CPG Products lost a lawsuit against Easter Unlimited, importers of a line known as "Message Bears". According to New York City judge Leonard B. Sand, those toys lacked the "heart-shaped 'touché tags'" used to identify the Care Bears.[10]
</p>

<p>In 1984, AGC introduced a spin-off line, the Care Bear Cousins. Another syndicated special, The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine, came out that same year. A miniseries based on the toys was distributed by Lexington Broadcast Services Company.[3]:52 A year later, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins appeared in the Canadian-American animated film The Care Bears Movie, produced by Nelvana Limited and released by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. It became the highest-grossing animated film made outside the Disney market at the time of its release.[11] Later that autumn, DIC Audiovisuel released an 11-episode television series in syndication, which incorporated elements from the Atkinson Film-Arts specials (with the specials' villains Professor Coldheart and his sidekick Frostbite appearing regularly, and some of the music from the specials being featured in the series) and the Nelvana film (with the Forest of Feelings, the home of the Care Bear Cousins, being a regular setting in the series).[12][13]
</p>

<p>In 1986, Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second film, Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation. Released by Columbia Pictures, the film featured a new villain, Dark Heart, and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins: Harmony Bear, True Heart Bear, and Noble Heart Horse.
</p>

<p>Later that year, the TV series The Care Bears Family (also from Nelvana) premiered in mid-1986 on the U.S. ABC network and Canada's Global.[14] Lasting three seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes, this introduced the evil wizard No Heart and his sidekick Beastly. In the second season, No Heart's niece Shreeky was introduced. It also added more development to the Care Bear characters, with issues such as conflict and depression being addressed through the characters themselves in some episodes.
</p>

<p>The Care Bears' third film, The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland, debuted in 1987. A TV special, Care Bears Nutcracker Suite, which also served as the series finale for The Care Bears Family premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988.
</p>

<p>Over 40 million Care Bears were sold between 1983 and 1987, and American Greetings printed over 70 million of their cards during the decade. In whole, the sales of their merchandise reached over $2 million during the 1980s.[15][16]
</p>
<h3>1991 relaunch <em>(Caring About the Enviornment)</em></h3>
<p>
	In 1991, Those Characters from Cleveland and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise, involving seven bears. One of the Care Bear Cousins, Proud Heart Cat, was released as a bear with white fur that sported the tummy symbol of a heart-shaped American flag.[17] The publishing company Random House released two tie-in books: The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup (1991) by Bobbi Katz,[18][19] and The Care Bears and the Whale Tale (1992) by Peggy Kahn.[20][21]
</p>
<h3>2002 relaunch</h3>
<p>In 1999, the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by Jay Foreman, the president of Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Play Along Toys, for less than $1 million; he also planned to acquire fellow American Greeting Cards property Strawberry Shortcake.[22] Three years later, Kenton Avery Frederick American Greetings relaunched the Care Bear brand as part of the Bears' 20th-anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and films. The artwork and design of the bears were changed for the relaunch. Also, Champ Bear's colors were changed from tan to true blue, with his belly symbol changed to a winner's cup with a star, and Share Bear's belly symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change because sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the belly symbols.
</p>
<p>During this revival Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as Walmart, Kmart, Toys "R" Us, Target, KB Toys, and Mervyns.[23] The new merchandise included the Bears doing aerobics; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs.[24] Over 70 million 13-inch (330 mm) plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch.[25]
</p>
<p>New versions of the Care Bear Cousins were produced (with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat, in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13-inch plush toys in the 2000s, and the Care Bear Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.
</p>
<p>In April 2003, it was announced that a new CGI-animated movie from Nelvana, The Care Bears in King Funshine the Great, was acquired by Artisan Entertainment for US distribution. The movie was eventually renamed Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot and was released on October 5, 2004 by Lions Gate Home Entertainment, as they had acquired Artisan by this point, with International distribution done through Universal Studios Home Video.[26] Another CGI-animated movie The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie would be released a year later. Another CGI-animated movie from Nelvana was also planned but was scrapped.
